Text In File Search 

This is a little program to search for particular words in files in particular folder. Windows Find feature does search for a particular string in files but you can't search for Word1 AND Word2 AND Word3. This program does just that. I made this program mainly to search for specific piece of code from 1000s of VB source code samples stored on my hard drive. This application is right now in state of easy installation and no on-line help is available. You may freely contact me for assistance however.
